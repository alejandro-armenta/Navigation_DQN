# Navigation_DQN
 
 This is a DQN (Deep Q Network) that trains an agent to collect yellow bananas in Unity Environment.
 
 This is an example of the environment:
 
 ![banana](https://github.com/alejandro-armenta/Navigation_DQN/assets/81542828/d5333d2c-12d2-4d8e-9b55-6604d9903b8a)
 
 ## State space
 
 The state space has 37 dimensions with the agent's velocity and agent's perception around forward direction.
 
 ## Action space
 
 4 discrete actions:
 - Move forward
 - Move backward
 - Turn left
 - Turn right
 
 ## Rewards
 
 The yellow bananas give +1 reward and the blue bananas give -1 reward.
 
 ## Environment solution
 
 The agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes for the environment to be considered solved.
